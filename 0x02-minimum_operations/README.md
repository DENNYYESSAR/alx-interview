# Minimum Operations Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on calculating the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific number of characters in a text file using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste". The challenge is to determine the most efficient way to obtain exactly `n` 'H' characters starting from a single 'H'. This problem requires a deep understanding of algorithmic concepts and mathematical strategies.

## Key Concepts and Resources

To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand the following concepts:

### 1. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a technique that helps in breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, dynamic programming can significantly improve the efficiency of your solution.

### 2. Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is the process of determining the prime numbers that multiply together to give a particular integer. In this problem, prime factorization is essential because the solution involves summing the prime factors of the target number `n`.

### 3. Code Optimization
Optimizing your code ensures that it runs efficiently, especially when dealing with large inputs. Understanding various optimization techniques will help you find the most efficient solution to this problem.

### 4. Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms make decisions that seem best at the moment with the hope of finding a global optimum. In this problem, a greedy approach can be useful in deciding which operation to perform at each step.

### 5. Basic Python Programming
Proficiency in Python is required to implement the solution. You should be comfortable with Python's loops, conditionals, and functions to complete this task.

## Task

### 0. Minimum Operations (Mandatory)

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file:

- **Copy All**
- **Paste**

Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file.

```python
